"eventually that string will wear out, break". but it never did. and it feels like it never will, though if it somehow splits in two, it's going to take time. a lot of it, but that’s ok. i've come to terms with the fact that healing is a time-consuming process, sometimes painful. which is ironic, yet understandable. the thing is you never stop healing and in order to grow you might face challenges and it's how you handle them that allows you to do so. time itself won't do anything.<br><br>it really is up to you.`,
